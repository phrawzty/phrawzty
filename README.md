Hi there! I'm Dan (`phrawzty` on all the things). I work at <a href="https://github.com/datadog/">Datadog</a> on the Community team. I'm also a Global Core member of the <a href="https://devopsdays.org/">devopsdays</a> conference series. My preferred pronouns are `he / him`. Ask me about time zones and/or whisk(e)y! ðŸ˜€
