### Bonjour ðŸ‘‹

Hi there! I'm Dan (_phrawzty_ on all the things). I have previously done computer stuff at [Scaleway](https://github.com/scaleway), [Datadog](https://github.com/DataDog/), [Mozilla](https://github.com/mozilla), and [Ubisoft](https://github.com/ubisoft). I'm also a Global Core member of the <a href="https://devopsdays.org/">devopsdays</a> conference series. My pronouns are `he / him`. Ask me about time zones or French wine! ðŸ˜€
